The web data connector (WDC) version 3.0 is a complete rewrite of the web data connector model used in previous versions. 

## Extensible Protocol Server

In version 3.0, we introduce the extensible protocol server (EPS). EPS is the server that runs your web data connector. An EPS-based connector is a web application that does not require a web server.

## Taco Toolkit

To help you build and configure your EPS-based web data connector, we also created the Taco Toolkit. The Taco Toolkit is a command-line interface (CLI) that you use to create, build and package your EPS-based connector.
